# Sound-Sensing-Lights

This project's goal was to flash LED's when sound was detected through the KY-037 Sound Sensing Module. To better understand the KY-037 module, I took a look at this [documentation](https://www.robotshop.com/media/files/pdf/sound-sensor-module-arduino-datasheet.pdf), I highly recommend you to take a look at it too.

- ## **Main Components:**
Along with the three main components listed below, a solderless breadboard and jumper wires are required.

- ## **Functionality of the KY-037 module:**
- The KY-037 Sound Sensing Module is used for detecting sound, as the name might suggest. This module can be utilized with both digital and analog output. For this project we have used the digital output for visualization purposes. The digital output plays a key role as it activates when the level of sound reaches a certain point. The sensor's reactivity can be changed with the potentiometer that is present on it.
